# Mobile Microphone
The intention of this software is to enable users to utilize their mobile phone as a microphone for online gaming, VOIP programs, and telecommunication. To differentiate from similiar programs, this software is cross platform between IOS and Android, all the while being free.

****Important Notice****</br>
I am considering creating a web application instead of apps for each application.</br>
</br>
**Windows Progress**
  - Backend 60%
    - Batch scripts need to be written.
    - Jitter Buffer needs implementation.
  - Frontend 0% (will start once backend is complete).
</br>
</br>

**Android**
  - Backend 90%
    - Need to convert the packets to adhere to RTP.
  - Frontend 50%
    - Need to add transitions between the GUI but the layout is completed.
</br>
</br>

**IOS**
  - Backend 0%
  - Frontend 0%
</br>
</br>


**Future plans **
  - Two way audio streaming (windows computer streams audio to mobile device and vice versa)
  - C++ implementation (need to look into 3rd party libraries)
</br>
